# Encoder 
encoder_pin: ^ercf:PA6
encoder_resolution: 1.367989 # in mm
# Speeds and accels
# Long moves are faster than the small ones
# 100mm/s should be "quiet" with the NEMA14 motor or a NEMA17 pancake, but you can go lower if your really want it to be low noise
# Tested without any issue at 200mm/s, but it's noisy. I'm running mine at 170mm/s for long moves and 50mm/s for short moves.
long_moves_speed: 100 # mm/s. Default value is 100mm/s.
long_moves_accel: 400 # mm/s². Default value is 400mm/s²
short_moves_speed: 25 # mm/s. Default value is 25mm/s.
short_moves_accel: 400 # mm/s². Default value is 400mm/s²

# ================== VALUES TO ADJUST ===================
# =======================================================
#
# ==== Toolhead specific values ====
#
# Distance between the end of the reverse bowden and the toolhead sensor. Value is toolhead specific.
# Tested values :
# Galileo Clockwork with ERCF V1.1 sensor (hall effect) : 27.0
# LGX on AfterBurner with ERCF V1.1 sensor (hall effect) : 44.0
# AfterBurner Clockwork with ERCF V1.1 sensor (hall effect) : 36.0
variable_end_of_bowden_to_sensor: 36.0
# Length from the sensor to the nozzle melt pool.
# Reduce this value if there are blobs of filament on each load, before the purge on the tower.
# Increase this value if there are big gaps on the purge tower (i.e. if it takes time for the filament to get pushed out after a swap)
# Tested values :
# Galileo Clockwork with ERCF 1.1 sensor (hall effect) & Dragon Normal Flow : 60.5
# LGX on AfterBurner with ERCF 1.1 sensor (hall effect) & Dragon Normal Flow : 55.6
# AfterBurner Clockwork with ERCF 1.1 sensor (hall effect) & Dragon Normal Flow : 54.0
variable_sensor_to_nozzle: 54.0

# ==== Values to tune ====

# Tool position for the selector. This has to be tuned manually. Please scale this array to the number of tools you have

# Base value for the loading length used by the auto-calibration macro
# Please use a value SMALLER than the real reverse bowden length (like 50mm less)
variable_min_bowden_length: 470.0
# Servo angle for the Up position (i.e. tool disengaged). Refer to the manual to know how to properly tune this value
# Default values:
# MG90S servo : 30
# SAVOX SH0255MG : 140
variable_servo_up_angle: 30
# Servo angle for the Down position (i.e. tool engaged). Refer to the manual to know how to properly tune this value
# Default values:
# MG90S servo : 140
# SAVOX SH0255MG : 30
variable_servo_down_angle: 130
# Threshold for the final load check (i.e. the move from the toolhead sensor to the nozzle)
# Check the _ERCF_GET_LOAD_THRESHOLD command to get the proper value for your setup
variable_final_load_check_threshold: 10.0
# Options to use or not 
# Beware that the clog detection and endless spool mode are in BETA mode for now
